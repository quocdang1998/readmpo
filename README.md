Library for decoding and retrieving data from MPO libraries resulted from APOLLO3 lattice calculations that used
homogenization in space and condensation in energy. Microscopic and macroscopic cross section, as well as zone flux and
reaction rate are saved in a serialized format (using C++ executable), or a Python dictionary format (using Python API).

Please contact Dinh Quoc Dang Nguyen for bugs.
